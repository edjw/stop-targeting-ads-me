### What is this site?

**Stop Targeting Ads at Me** helps you turn off the targeting of adverts at you. This targeting is usually based on data about how you behave online, who you are, or who you interact with.

**If you'd prefer that data about you wasn't used to target ads at you**, you may find this website useful. You can find out the best way to turn off ad targeting and/or data collection for {{ site.items.size }} of the websites, apps, or products you use without spending hours navigating complex settings pages.

You may see this kind of advertising referred to in ways including: *targeted*, *tailored*, *personalised*, *interest-based*, *behavioural*, *ads that interest you*, *audience-based*, *activity-based*, and *relevant*.

*Stop Targeting Ads at Me* highlights ways of turning off targeting within the user profile of each service or across every service on a single device. This means you only have to turn off the targeting once for each service or product you use. Your choice should then apply everywhere you are logged in, including on different browsers and devices.

**Ideally, the burden on individual users to turn off targeting of ads wouldn't be so great as visiting lots of websites individually.**

There should be better options available so people can control this in a comprehensive way without needing a site like this to guide them through the depths of settings pages. This website is a stop-gap that tries to make it easier to opt out until better options exist.

### Other attempts to deal with this issue

[Ad industry efforts do exist](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices) to help people opt out of online behavioural advertising in limited ways.

There are industry-made browser add-ons for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youronlinechoices-plugin) and [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/protect-my-choices/hdgloanjhdcenjgiafkpbehddcnonlic) to opt out of 'interest-based' ads from participating behavioural advertising companies.

You can also [use this page](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices) to opt out of lots of companies' targeted ads. Wait for the page to load, then scroll down a bit and click on the red 'Turn off all companies' button that appears on the left. This page doesn't work properly if you have an adblocker browser add-on installed.

Both these approaches above apply on the individual browser level (eg, Firefox, Chrome, Safari). This means you have to would have to repeat these steps on every browser and on every computer you use. They also won't/can't affect data collection from apps, TVs, e-readers, or anything else that isn't a browser.

### Limitations

After you turn off this targeting, you will still be served with advertising. But this advertising should not be based on this behavioural and demographic data any more. In some cases, you may still be served with ads based on your rough location or the content of the website you're on.

The websites, apps, and products on this website currently skew a bit towards those which are popular in the UK.
