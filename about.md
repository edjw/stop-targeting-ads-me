**Stop Targeting Ads at Me** helps you turn off the targeting of adverts at you. This targeting is usually based on data about how you behave online, who you are, or who you interact with.

**If you would prefer data about you not to be used to target ads at you**, you can use this website to find out the best way to turn off targeting for the websites, apps, or products you use.

You may see this kind of advertising referred to in ways including:

- targeted,
- tailored,
- personalised,
- interest-based,
- behavioural,
- ads that interest you,
- audience-based,
- activity-based, and
- relevant.

[Ad industry efforts do exist](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices) to help people turn off online behavioural advertising. These systems apply settings on the browser level (eg, Firefox, Chrome, Safari). This means you have to turn off this targeted advertising on every browser and on every computer you use. The system is also quite difficult to use.

*Stop Targeting Ads at Me* takes a different approach to the ad industry. This website suggests ways of turning off targeting within the user profile of each service. This means you only have to turn off the targeting once for each service or product you use. Your choice should then will apply everywhere you are logged in.

After you turn off this targeting, you will still be served with advertising. But this advertising should not be based on this behavioural and demographic data any more.

At the moment, **the best way of suggesting further companies and products to add to this site is probably to [contact me through Twitter](https://twitter.com/_edjw).** If you are keen and a (little) bit technical, take a look at [these instructions on Github about how to add more companies and products to the site](https://github.com/edjw/stop-targeting-ads-me#how-to-add-a-company-or-product-to-the-site).

The websites, apps, and products on this website currently skew a bit towards those which are popular in the UK.

**[An always up-to-date JSON file](/api/api.json) is available** which, for each of the services on this website, contains: the name(s), link to the page on this website, opt-out link(s), and opt-out instructions.

**This is [a personal project by Ed Johnson-Williams](https://twitter.com/_edjw).** Let me know if you have any thoughts about how to make this site better! :-)
