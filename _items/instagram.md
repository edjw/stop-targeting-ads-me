**Firstly**, turn off targeted ads on the devices you use:

* [Apple iPhones and iPads](/apple-iphone-ipad)
* [Android devices](/android)
* [Windows Mobile devices](/windows-mobile)

**Also, if you have a Facebook account**, follow these instructions on Facebook using the link above in the 'Link to opt out section'.

1. You will probably have a lot of 'Interests' and 'Advertisersâ€¦who use a contact list' added to Facebook. These are contact lists of people's email addresses/phone numbers that advertisers upload to Facebok. You can click the Remove button on all of them or, to save time, use [this script](https://gist.github.com/edjw/8f398366bcf98bec09d282b79c030edd).

   **Facebook will add more interests and advertisers back to this over time, so you might want to check back here regularly.**

2. In 'Your Information', disable 'Relationship status', 'Employer', 'Job title', and 'Education'

3. In 'Ad Settings', turn 'Ads based on data from partners' and 'Ads based on your activity on Facebook Company Products that you see elsewhere' to Not Allowed. Turn 'Ads that include your social actions' to 'No one'.

4. In 'Hide ad topics', turn 'Alcohol', 'Parenting', and 'Pets' to 'Hide Permanently'.
