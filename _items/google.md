This applies to Google and YouTube, but not to other websites and apps that use Google ad services.

1. Click or tap the slider next to 'Ads Personalisation' so it says OFF.
2. Uncheck the checkbox next to "Based upon my activity, Google may show my profile name, profile photo, and activity in shared endorsements in ads".
