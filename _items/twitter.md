1. On the "Interests from Twitter" page, you will probably have a checkmark next to a lot of categories. You can uncheck all the Interests or, to save time, use [this script](https://gist.github.com/edjw/61cda68535b237fa7fa8db23842c1b6d).

   **Twitter will add more interests back to this over time, so you might want to check back here regularly.** Those new interests may have very similar names to ones you previously removed.

2. On the "Personalisation and Data" page, click the 'Disable All' button at the top of the page. Click 'Save changes'.
